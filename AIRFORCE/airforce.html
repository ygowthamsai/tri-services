    <u><b style="font-size: 20px">The Indian Air Force (IAF)</b></u> is the
    air arm of the Indian Armed Forces. Its primary mission is to secure
    Indian airspace and to conduct aerial warfare during armed conflicts. It
    was officially established on 8 October 1932 as an auxiliary air force of
    the British Empire which honoured India's aviation service during World
    War II with the prefix Royal.After India gained independence from United
    Kingdom in 1947, the name Royal Indian Air Force was kept and served in
    the name of the Dominion of India. With the transition to a republic in
    1950, the prefix Royal was removed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since 1950, the IAF has been involved in four wars with neighbouring
    Pakistan. Other major operations undertaken by the IAF include
    <u><b>Operation Vijay, Operation Meghdoot, Operation Cactus and Operation
        Poomalai.</b></u>
    The IAF's mission expands beyond engagement with hostile forces, with the
    IAF participating in United Nations peacekeeping missions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The President of India holds the rank of Supreme Commander of the IAF. As
    of 1 July 2017, 170,576 personnel are in service with the Indian Air
    Force.The Chief of the Air Staff, an air chief marshal, is a four-star
    officer and is responsible for the bulk of operational command of the Air
    Force. There is never more than one serving ACM at any given time in the
    IAF. The rank of Marshal of the Air Force has been conferred by the
    President of India on one occasion in history, to Arjan Singh. On 26
    January 2002, Singh became the first and so far, only five-star rank
    officer of the IAF.

  <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px">
    The IAF's mission is defined by the Armed Forces Act of 1947, the
    Constitution of India, and the Air Force Act of 1950. It decrees that in

      The secondary purpose is to assist civil power during natural calamities

      The IAF provides close air support to the Indian Army troops in the

      IAF also provides strategic air lift or secondary Airlift for the Indian
      Army.

      The IAF also operates the Integrated Space Cell together with the other

    <h3>Commands Of The Indian Air Force</h3>
  </u>
  <p>
    The Indian Air Force is divided into five operational and two functional
    commands. Each Command is headed by an Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief
    with the rank of Air Marshal. The purpose of an operational command is to
    conduct military operations using aircraft within its area of
    responsibility, whereas the responsibility of functional commands is to
    maintain combat readiness. Aside from the Training Command at Bangalore,
    the primary flight training is done at the Air Force Academy (located in
    Hyderabad), followed by operational training at various other schools.
    Advanced officer training for command positions is also conducted at the
    Defence Services Staff College; specialised advanced flight training
    schools are located at Bidar, Karnataka and Hakimpet, Telangana (also the
    location for helicopter training). Technical schools are found at a number
    of other locations
  </p>
  <u>
    <h3>Squadrons and Units</h3>
  </u>
  <p>
    Squadrons are the field units and formations attached to static locations.
    Thus, a flying squadron or unit is a sub-unit of an air force station
    which carries out the primary task of the IAF. A fighter squadron consists
    of 18 aircraft; all fighter squadrons are headed by a commanding officer
    with the rank of wing commander.Some transport squadrons and helicopter
    units are headed by a commanding officer with the rank of group captain.
  </p>
  <u>
    <h2>Garud Commando Force</h2>
  </u>
  <p>
    The Garud commandos are the special forces of the Indian Air Force (IAF).
    Their tasks include counter-terrorism, hostage rescue, providing security
    to IAF's vulnerably located assets and various air force-specific special
    operations. First conceived in 2002, this unit was officially established
    on February 6, 2004.

  </p>

  <p>
    The Garud Commando Force is the special forces unit of the Indian Air
    Force. It was formed on 6 February 2004 and with a plan to have around
    2,000-personnel strength.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2001, after the terrorists attempted to attack two major airfield bases
    in Jammu and Kashmir, the Indian Air Force commanders felt the need for a
    specialized force for protecting these critical elements should have
    dedicated commandos trained with Special Forces techniques such as Counter
    Insurgency (COIN) Operations, Combat Search and Rescue, Reconnaissance,
    for encountering and neutralizing the airfield based terror-threats.</p>
  <p>While
    the Army might have provided some Special forces units to the Air Force,
    its units were always subject to being posted out on rotation to other
    areas as per the Army's requirements. It was felt that the specialized
    training the Air Force would have provided for such units would have to be
    repeated for the replacement units. The initial plans mooted in October
    2001 called for a specialized force with 2000 commandos. The group was
    originally called "Tiger Force", but was later renamed as "Garud
    Force".To address the need for a dedicated force, in September 2003,
    the Government of India authorized a 1080-strong force to be raised and
    trained on the lines of the Para SF of the Army and MARCOS of the Indian
    Navy,with the mandate of performing niche, Air Force specific
    operational tasks.</p>
  <p> Soon after, the first batch of 100 volunteers from the
    IAF No.1 Airmen Training Center at Belgaum, Karnataka were earmarked to
    undergo Garud Training at Gurgaon. The Garuds were first unveiled on 6
    February 2004, when the first batch of 62 "Air Commandos" passed out of
    training in New Delhi.The Garuds were first seen publicly
    during the Air Force Day celebrations in New Delhi on 8 October 2004.
    In the aftermath of the Pathankot Terror Attack, the Indian Air Force
    decided to raise ten additional squadrons of Garud commandos, comprising
    about 700 personnel, bringing the total strength of the force to
    1780.
  </p>
  <p>
    All Garuds are volunteers who are imparted a 52-week basic training, which
    includes a three-month probation followed by special operations training,
    basic airborne training and other warfare and survival skills. The last
    phase of basic training sees Garuds been deployed to get combat
    experience. Advanced training follows, which includes specialised weapons
    training.The mandated tasks of the Garuds include direct action, special
    reconnaissance, rescuing downed pilots in hostile territory, establishing
    airbases in hostile territory and providing air-traffic control to these
    airbases.The Garuds also undertake suppression of enemy air defences and
    the destruction of other enemy assets such as radars, evaluation of the
    outcomes of Indian airstrikes and use laser designators to guide Indian
    airstrikes.The security of IAF installations and assets are usually
    performed by the Air Force Police and the Defence Security Corps even
    though some critical assets are protected by the Garuds.
