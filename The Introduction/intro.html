    <u><b style="color: #046d0baf">The Indian Army</b></u>, being the largest branch, is a great place to begin our
    discussion.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Indian Army is the largest branch of the Indian Armed Forces,
    dedicated to safeguarding the nation's borders, maintaining internal
    security, and responding to national emergencies. A pillar of strength,
    the Army has been at the forefront in defending India against external
    threats and providing humanitarian aid during natural disasters. With its
    rich legacy dating back to 1776, it is an institution built on honor,
    courage, and sacrifice. The Army's regiments, many with centuries-old
    traditions, remain a proud symbol of India's resolve. Its valorous
    soldiers, drawn from all corners of the nation, are trained to excel in
    diverse terrains—whether the icy heights of the Himalayas or the arid
    expanse of the Thar Desert. The Indian Army’s ethos is embodied in its
    motto, “<u><b style="color: #046d0baf">Service Before Self (or) Seva Paramo Dharma</b></u>” a guiding principle that
    continues to inspire generations.
  </p>
  <p>
    <u><b style="color: #161de0af">The Indian Navy,</b></u> with its advanced
    fleet and global operations, safeguards India's maritime interests and
    trade routes
  </p>
  <p>
    As a global maritime power, India’s naval strength is indispensable for
    the security of its vast coastline and vital sea lanes. The Indian Navy
    stands as a formidable force, tasked with securing India's maritime
    borders, projecting power beyond the seas, and ensuring the free flow of
    commerce and trade. Operating from the Bay of Bengal to the Arabian Sea
    and beyond, the Navy is an instrument of deterrence, humanitarian
    assistance, and diplomacy. With cutting-edge warships, submarines, and
    aircraft, it is equipped to counter evolving threats while maintaining
    peace on the high seas. The Navy’s motto, “<u><b style="color: #161de0af">Sham-no Varuna</b></u>”, reflects its
    dedication to duty, leadership, and courage in times of
    peace and war alike. The Navy not only plays a crucial role in national
    defense but also represents India's maritime aspirations and global
    presence.
  </p>
  <p>
    <u><b style="color: #2fc0cb">The Indian Air Force</b></u>, equipped with cutting-edge technology, ensures the
    nation’s skies
    remain secure.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Indian Air Force (IAF) is the aerial arm of the Indian military,
    entrusted with the protection of India’s airspace and the rapid deployment
    of force in times of conflict. From safeguarding India's skies to
    providing strategic airlift capabilities, the IAF is the first line of
    defense in an increasingly aerial and technological age. The IAF is
    equipped with state-of-the-art fighter jets, surveillance systems, and
    transport aircraft, enabling it to respond with precision and agility
    across vast distances. Whether it's securing India’s borders, conducting
    humanitarian missions, or aiding disaster relief, the IAF has earned a
    reputation for professionalism and excellence. The motto “<u><b style="color: #e0ebec">Nabha Sparsham Deeptam
        (or)Touch the Sky with Glory</b></u>” encapsulates the force’s relentless pursuit of superiority in the skies
    and its unflinching commitment to national security.
